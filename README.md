# CQMachine

This script will generate a bash script, with all the commands necessary to run a virtual machine inside QEMU (creating disks, setting ram, cpu cores, etc).

## Quick Start

`cd` into the folder where you want the virtual machine files to be created, and execute:
```console
$ cqmachine
```
This will ask the user for the machine specifications (ram, storage, cpu, etc).
